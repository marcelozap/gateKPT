"""MoveNet pose backend — NOT IMPLEMENTED.

This file exists so `get_backend("movenet")` fails in the right place with the
right message, and so implementing the backend is a matter of filling in two
methods rather than working out the shape from scratch.

WHAT TO IMPLEMENT
  1. `__init__`  — lazily import the runtime (tensorflow / tflite-runtime) the
     same way `mediapipe_backend.py` does. This file and that one are the ONLY
     files allowed to import a model runtime; keep it inside the method so an
     unused backend never has to be installed.
  2. `estimate`  — MoveNet returns 17 COCO keypoints as (y, x, score) in
     NORMALISED coordinates, in that order. Note the axis order: it is (y, x),
     not (x, y). Map them through `_LANDMARK_MAP` below, and pass `score`
     through as `Keypoint.visibility` so `PoseFrame.has()` keeps working.
     Return None when the person score is below the detection threshold.
  3. `close`     — release the interpreter.

WHAT NOT TO DO
  - Do not import numpy/tf at module scope beyond what is already here.
  - Do not add MoveNet-specific joint names. Everything downstream speaks
    `core.types.Joint`; that mapping is this file's entire job.
  - Do not commit the weights. `.gitignore` already excludes `models/**`;
    fetch them in `scripts/` and keep a pointer.

MoveNet has no torso-visibility notion the way MediaPipe does, so `visibility`
will be a keypoint confidence rather than an occlusion estimate. That is fine
for the current thresholds but worth remembering when tuning.
